npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network bscTestnet

# Verify on BSCScan Testnet
npx hardhat verify --network bscTestnet <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> "<FEE_WALLET_ADDRESS>"
```

### Mainnet Deployment
```bash
# Deploy to BSC Mainnet
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network bscMainnet

# Verify on BSCScan Mainnet
npx hardhat verify --network bscMainnet <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> "<FEE_WALLET_ADDRESS>"
```

# Run tests
npx hardhat test

# Gas reporting
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
```

### Testnet Testing Checklist
- [ ] Deploy to BSC Testnet
- [ ] Verify contract on testnet BSCScan
- [ ] Test game creation with tBNB
- [ ] Test game joining and completion
- [ ] Test reveal mechanism
- [ ] Test timeout claims
- [ ] Test admin functions
- [ ] Test emergency functions
- [ ] Monitor gas usage

## üìà Post-Deployment

### Frontend Updates Required
1. Update `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` in `src/contexts/Web3Context.tsx`
2. Update chain ID references from 1116 to 56
3. Update currency references from CORE to BNB
4. Update explorer links to BSCScan
5. Test wallet connection to BSC

### API Updates Required
1. Update `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` in `src/api/server.ts`
2. Update RPC URL to BSC endpoint
3. Update chain ID in responses
4. Test API endpoints with new contract

### Monitoring Setup
1. Set up BSCScan API monitoring
2. Monitor contract balance and reward pool
3. Track gas usage optimization
4. Monitor player activity and game creation

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common BSC Issues
- **Gas Price Too Low**: Increase gas price for faster confirmation
- **Nonce Issues**: Reset MetaMask account if transactions stuck
- **RPC Limits**: Use multiple RPC endpoints for reliability
- **Contract Size**: Use optimizer if contract too large

### Emergency Procedures
1. **Pause Contract**: Call `pause()` if issues detected
2. **Emergency Withdraw**: Use `emergencyWithdraw()` when paused
3. **Update Fee Wallet**: Change fee destination if needed
4. **Transfer Ownership**: Move control to new address if required

## üìû Support

- **Contract Issues**: Check BSCScan for transaction details
- **Gas Problems**: Use BSC gas tracker for optimal pricing
- **Network Issues**: Try different BSC RPC endpoints
- **Security Concerns**: Contact OMDB security team
